lede-modhostapd

Modified version of hostapd / wpad that supports restricting AP clients to
only those which have a dBm signal above a settable threshold.

Use with LEDE 17.01.4.  (This version of LEDE includes KRACK attack
                         countermeasures.)
                         
At a public wifi hotspot, you will often find users (STAs) trying to use
the AP from the fringe area of coverage.  
This is not desirable for several reasons:

1 They must be served at a low data rate and excessive retries, reducing 
   the usable bandwidth of the AP.
2 They create a "hidden node" problem since STA's far on one side of the AP 
   cannot detect when those far on the other side are transmitting.  This
   results in packet collisions at the AP, requiring both STAs to retry.
3 Users may be outside the intended geographic coverage, such as a cafe.  This
   is a disadvantage to the owner who established the hotspot to encourage
   customers to stay inside the business.
   
Drawbacks 2 and 3 can be addressed by reducing the transmitter power of 
the AP.  But that also reduces the signal delivered to all desired users,
reducing system performance.

This modification causes hostapd to monitor the signal strength from the 
STA's.  If they are above a (settable) threshold, operation of the AP 
proceeds normally.  If a STA's signal is below the threshold, that STA is
not allowed to connect, or dropped if it is already connected.  Probe requests
from weak STAs are also dropped.  This may have some usefulness by limiting
the AP's transmission of Probe Responses in a crowded area.  

This was tested with LEDE 17.01.4 on ar71xx hardware, specifically a Netgear
R6100.  The MediaTek driver is known not to work (no signal report on 
management packets).  Other drivers may or may not work.

BUILD: 
Install the LEDE buildroot. (git.lede-project.org/source.git)
Check out stable version 17.01.4 (git checkout v17.01.4)
Follow LEDE instructions to build a default config for your router.  Be
sure one of the variants of wpad is selected (usually wpad-mini or wpad,
the full version supports 802.1X)
Copy the files and patches from this git to the buildroot at
   packages/network/services/hostapd
Rebuild the hostapd package:
make package/hostapd/{clean,compile}
Find the wpad-mini .ipk file in bin/packages/<target>/base

INSTALL:
At this point it is ready to install on your router.  Use either your built
binary or the 17.01.4 release binary from LEDE server.  The official binary
is preferable because it is compatible with online installation of pre-built
packages from the official server.

scp the just built wpad .ipk file your router's /tmp
also send the hostapd-common ipk (the configuration script)
ssh to the router
root@LEDE:~# opkg --force-reinstall install /tmp/hostapd-common<version>.ipk
root@LEDE:~# opkg --force-reinstall install /tmp/wpad-mini<version>.ipk
root@LEDE:~# reboot
A reboot seems to be necessary to get the UCI configuration system working
properly.
hostapd should now have restarted with the new version.  Confirm you are 
running the mod version by checking if the set_required_signal ubus call
exists:
root@LEDE:~# ubus -v list | grep set_required_signal
     "set_required_signal":{"connect":"Integer","stay":"Integer","strikes":
       "Integer","poll_time":"Integer","reason":"Integer"}

Important:  For routers with only 4 MB flash, it will not be possible to
do as shown above and remove the original wpad-mini to install a new one. 
A complete image must be built and flashed with the new wpad-mini in the squashfs.

USAGE:
The threshold signal levels and other parameters can be set through UCI
in /etc/config/wireless, or through ubus calls.  ubus calls do not require
restarting the wifi system.

Configuration is on a per AP basis.  This means that one of your APs can
have signal limits, while another one on the same radio can have different
or no limits.

The following 5 keys are defined:
	option signal_connect "-60"  # dBm requred to connect
	option signal_stay "-75" # dBm required to stay connected
	option signal_strikes "3" # Number of polls below stay threshold before disconnection
	option signal_poll_time "10" # Seconds between polls (min. 3, default 10)
	option signal_drop_reason "3" # IEEE802.11 reason sent to the STA when it is dropped.
	
The settings above of -60 and -75 are reasonable starting points.  A dBm
value that is more negative means a weaker signal.  Observing the log with
typical users will show if the levels should be changed for your application.
Setting log_level '0' in the per-radio configuration will show more details,
including the signal measurements of each connected STA at each poll.	

When running with a "signal_stay" above -128 dBm you should see signal reports: 
daemon.debug hostapd: wlan0: STA f8:e0:79:XX:XX:XX IAPP: -35 -38 (0)
daemon.info hostapd: wlan0: IAPP signal poll: 1 STAs, 0 dropped
The report is instantaneous signal, average signal and (number of strikes)

Settable parameters are:
"connect": signal (dBm) required for a received Probe, Auth Request, or 
           Assoc Request to be acted upon.
"stay"   : signal (dBm) required to stay connected.
"strikes" : Number of consecutive bad signal polls allowed before disconnection.
            Default 3.
"poll_time" : Time in seconds between signal polls.  Default 10.
"reason"  : IEEE 802.11 reason that will be transmitted to the STA upon
            disconnection.  Default 3 (Local Choice).  5 (AP too busy) is a
            reasonable alternative.  This does not affect the operation of
            hostapd at all.  It may (or may not) affect what the STA does
            after it has been disconnected.
            
By default, signal_connect and signal_stay are -128 dBm.  This means that
all connections will be accepted and no polling will be done, the same as
with an unmodified hostapd.            

The options may be set with a ubus call.  This will not disconnect all the clients
like re-reading the config file does.

root@LEDE:~# ubus call hostapd.wlan0 set_required_signal '{"connect":-50,"stay":-50}'

Code details:
This project is based mostly on extending the ubus feature which allows dynamically
"banning" a STA based on MAC address.  A hook from the main part of hostapd
calls into the OpenWrt/LEDE-specific ubus.c module whenever a STA sends a
Probe, Authentication Request, or Association Request.  If the STA is not 
on the "banned" list, hostapd_ubus_handle_event will return 0 and hostapd
will respond to the request normally.  If the station is banned, the module
returns -2, which causes hostapd to drop (ignore) the request.

So it is straightforward to extend this logic by examining the signal level
metadata accompaining the packet and either accept or deny based on that.

Once allowed to connect, it is desirable to monitor the signal level of the
STA and drop them if they move away from the AP.  This is done by the 
hostapd_bss_signal_check() routine.  Once a station is fully connected, 
hostapd offloads the handling of data packets to the kernel driver.  Thus
hostapd is not aware of all packets received from the STA.  It is necessary
to call the driver to take a snapshot of the signal level.  These are the
same level numbers reported by for example iw station dump.

Since snapshot signal checks can be momentarilly low, signal_check has several
provisions to discourage the unwarranted dropping of a STA.  First if the 
instantaneous signal is more than 5 dB below the "average", the signal report
is ignored completely.  The higher of the instantaneous and average is
compared to the "stay" threshold.  If it is below threshold, a "strike" is 
recorded for that STA.  When the strikeout count is reached, the STA is de-
authenticated (dropped).  If the signal is above threshold, the strike count
is reset to 0.
